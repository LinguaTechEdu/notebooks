Classes are what saves us all that time and effort. Think of it like the printing press. Before the press scribes and writers had to painstakingly copy every book, letter, edict and poem to pass onto generations. With the press, one printer could set all the text on a machine and simple print off as many instances of today's news as she wanted! Classes afford us a similar thing."
